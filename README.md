# Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: Pulls location data from MBTA for buses between MIT, Harvard, and Boston University and displays them on a map. 

Future improvements: To add functionality to the Map, such as a NAV/search bar, hover and click to the markers, and an overall cleaner map view for the user. 

License information: The license I used for this project came from MIT and MapboxGl.
