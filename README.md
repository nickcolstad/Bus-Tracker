# Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: Pulls bus location data from MBTA for buses between MIT and Harvard and displays the locations on a map. 

Roadmap of future improvements: I plan to recreate this project for other cities and adding functionality to the markers so they will display bus information when the cursor hovers on them. When you click on the markers, the view will lock, which effectively will show a closer look at the bus locatin. I will also change the marker image to a bus and have ifferent colors for each bus.

License information: The license I used for this project came from MIT.
