# Real Time Bus Tracker

Description: Pulls location data from MBTA for buses between MIT, Harvard, and Boston University and displays them on a map. The map is an API coming from Mapbox. 

How to Run: Download the zip file locally to our computer and load the index file into the browser to see the bus locations on the map. 

Future improvements: To add functionality to the map, such as a NAV/search bar, hover and click to the markers, and an overall cleaner map view for the user. 

License information: The license I used for this project came from MIT and MapboxGl.
